"""
Amber â€” opinionated archive tooling focused on security and data integrity.

Features:

- Authenticated record stream (EntryBegin/Chunk/EntryEnd) with dual index trailers.
- Whole-archive AEAD via XChaCha20-Poly1305 with Argon2id key derivation.
- Built-in integrity (chunk tags, per-file hashes, archive Merkle root).
- First-class ECC: Local Repair Parity (LRP) plus RX rateless parity, with CLI helpers
  to verify, repair, harden (append parity), and rebuild damaged archives.
- Append-only workflows preserve existing payloads while refreshing anchors/index metadata.

Everything after the superblock is authenticated; parity and anchors remain encrypted
when a password is provided. See docs/AMBER-FORMAT.md for the on-disk format.
